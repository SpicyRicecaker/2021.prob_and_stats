For a sinusoidal wave of freq f, particles move in simple harmonic motion as a wave passes. Each particle has E=1/2kx0^2

x0 is the amplitude of its motion, transversely or longitudinoally


The formula for simple harmonic motion:
T=2pi\sqrt{m/k}
f=1/2pi * \sqrt{k/m}

The formula for mass, volume, and density
m=d*v

Plugging in mass and swapping out time and stuff for square of the amplitude
E=2\pi^2*d*A*v*f^2*x^2

This gives the result that the square of the amplitude (x0) is proportional to the erngy spent in an equation
